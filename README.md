# Project-8-thermometer
This program starts by setting the temperatures to each pin. Pin 6 is >26C and labeled as hot, pin 4 is normal which is >20C and <26C, and cold is pin 2 <20C. The reading from the temperature sensor is calculated into voltage then into celsius. If the sensor reads <20C pin 2 goes high turning on the LED and delays for 1 second before turning off. If it doesnt it then checks to see if the temperature is >20C and <26C. If temperature is normal then pin 4 goes high turning on the LED and delaying for 1 second before turning off. If it doesnt then pin 6 goes high repeating the same steps.
